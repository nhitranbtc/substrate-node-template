## H160


`H160` is a fixed-size hash type provided by the `sp_core` crate in Substrate. It represents a 160-bit (20-byte) hash, commonly used in blockchain applications for addresses and other identifiers.

### Details

- **Type**: `H160` is defined in the `sp_core` crate.
- **Usage**: Typically used for Ethereum addresses, which are 20 bytes (160 bits) long.

### Common Use Cases

- Representing Ethereum addresses in Substrate-based chains.
- Address mapping in EVM pallets.

### Related Types

- **H256**: 256-bit hash, often used for transaction hashes.
- **H512**: 512-bit hash, used for larger cryptographic operations.

### Usage

To use `H160`, include the `sp_core` crate in your dependencies and import `H160` in your Rust file.

```rust
use sp_core::H160;
use hex_literal::hex;

fn main() {
    // Create an H160 hash from a hex string
    let hash = H160::from_slice(&hex!("1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"));
    println!("H160 hash: {:?}", hash); // H160 hash: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678

    // Create an H160 hash from a low 64-bit unsigned integer
    let address: H160 = H160::from_low_u64_be(0x1234567890abcdef);
    println!("Address: {:?}", address); // Address: 0x0000000000000000000000001234567890abcdef

    // Assert the hash value
    assert_eq!(hash, H160::from_slice(&hex!("1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678")));
}
```

In this example, the `hex_literal` crate is used to easily convert a hex string to a byte array, which is then used to create an `H160` hash. The `H160::from_slice` method is used to create the hash from the byte array. Additionally, the `H160::from_low_u64_be` method is demonstrated to create an `H160` hash from a low 64-bit unsigned integer. The `assert_eq!` macro is used to verify that the created `H160` hash matches the expected value.
